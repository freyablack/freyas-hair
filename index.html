    <h3>Hey there! 
      <br> Chances are that you've ended up here either through my portfolio or because I've specifically given you the link to this site, either way have a look around and use the information if it applies to you!</h3>

        I'll start this out by saying that everything I say here is from my own experience and that everyone's hair is different, so your milage may vary. I will also be linking to other websites that I've found useful during my hair journey</p>
      <p>
        I follow what's called the <a href="/assets/curlyCare.jpg" target="blank"><b>"Curly Girl/Guy Method"</b></a>. The CGM (as I will now refer to it) is a hair care routine that is designed to be used on all types of curly hair (wavy, curly and coily are the main types and you can <a href="https://www.allure.com/gallery/curl-hair-type-guide" target="blank"><b>look here</b></a> to try and find what kind of curly your hair may be). For me, the CGM boils down to reducing the use of shampoo on your hair and mainly co-washing, which is washing your hair only with conditioner. There are also many ingredients in hair products that the CGM encourages you to avoid, mostly <b>Sulphates</b>, <b>Silicones</b>, and <b>Drying Alcohols</b>. A helpful site I've found to check for these is <a href="http://www.isitcg.com/" target="blank"><b>Is it CG?</b></a>, all you do is copy/paste the products ingredients into the box on that website and it will tell you if it finds any that aren't CG approved.

      <div class="routine">
        <p>
          The routine I've found that works best for me is co-washing my hair at most every other day (usually 2 days between washes) and then clarifying once a month (or more, depending on how my hair feels or how much product I've been using. Some say at least once every 4-8 weeks). For co-washing I just apply conditioner as I normally would, and then use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scalp-Massager-Shampoo-Brush-MAXSOFT/dp/B074ZDXFL6" target="blank"><b>scalp massager</b></a> to make sure I'm exfoliating my scalp and getting it clean. When I'm ready to rinse out the conditioner I do whats called <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a37304107/squish-to-condish/" target="blank"><b>Squish to Condish</b></a>, which is basically running some water into your hair, then squishing the water and conditioner together in your hair to make sure your hair is absorbing all of the moisture that it can (moisture is very important to curly hair). When it comes to drying my hair I only use <a href="https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curls/top-tips-for-using-a-microfiber-towel-on-curly-hair" target="blank"><b>microfiber towels</b></a> on it. This alone has helped show a major improvement in my hair's overall health and curl health. For styling I like to use curl creams to help tame frizz and also add a little bit more ooph to my curls, but honestly most mornings I just re-wet my hair entirely, partially dry with my microfiber towel and then let it air dry the rest of the way.
